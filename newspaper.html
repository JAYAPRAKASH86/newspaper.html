            <p>India's XPoSat: India's first dedicated polarimetry mission, launched on January 1, 2024, to study X-ray emissions from celestial objects.
                NASA's PACE: Launched in February 2024, the Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, Ocean Ecosystem (PACE) satellite studies ocean health, atmospheric particles, and climate interactions.
                China's Chang'e 6: Launched in May 2024, it aims to collect and return lunar samples from the far side of the Moon, offering insights into its geological history. It successfully landed on the Moon on June 1, 2024.
                Europe's Ariane 6: The maiden flight of this heavy-lift launcher took place in July 2024, aiming to boost Europe's capabilities for launching heavier payloads. However, the second stage failed to relight due to an auxiliary power unit anomaly.
                Japan's ALOS-4: Launched on July 1, 2024, it carries a L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensor for observing disaster-hit areas, forests, sea-ice, and infrastructure displacement.
                SpaceX Starlink Launches: SpaceX continued its rapid deployment of Starlink satellites throughout 2024. However, a Falcon 9 suffered a rare engine failure during a Starlink mission on July 11, 2024, resulting in the loss of 20 satellites.
